# TODO's and ISSUES

## Planned for version 1.1

- active github issues:  https://github.com/astroumd/lmtoy/issues
- add the repo counter into the fits header of final output
- autorun mode (restart=2) [partially implemented]
- resolve tsys_aver in lmtslr/spec/spec.py as per Heyer
- fill in all metadata for DV
- comments.txt needs to differentiate with different banks (o__b)
- RMS0:   should we define some <Tsys>?  Currently RMS0 is defined per 100K (as is for RSR)
- SEQ/Bs only one bank works now
- SEQ/Ps not implemented
- Autoscaling the rather wide HTML pages for SEQ summary
- revive maskmoment (has an import issue)
- split parameters in single obsnum and combo (where only gridding is allowed) - useful for webrun
- verify script that checks a runfile (or rc file)
- pointing offsets from ifproc in meta-data ?
