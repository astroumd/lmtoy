Useful third party tools
========================

Here we list some potentially useful tools you might need to install
in your environment for advanced analysis of your LMT spectra. They are
not supported by LMTOY, but we have installation guidelines and
examples of usage for some of them.

Gridders
--------

Although we have our own gridder (in C), gridding and krigins are a cottage industry.
Where appropriate, we will describe which ones are of interest to us in this toolbox.

* cygrid (Effelsberg)

* HCGrid (FAST)

* gbtgridder

* SD gridder (Wenger)

* otfmap (Rosolowsky)


LineStacker

SpecUtils
---------

`specutils <https://specutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_,
one of the astropy packages, had a number of tools that are likely useful
for post calibration analysis of LMT spectra. We have an SDFITS loader
in our previous GBTOY toolbox.
