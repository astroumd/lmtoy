SDFITS
======

SDFITS is still a draft standard written up by Liszt (1995), with some more
documentation by Garwood (2000?).

The idea for LMT is to take a RAW (netCDF) data from the different
Spectral Line instruments, and allow a first pass (TSYS and ON/OFF)
calibration, such that the SDFITS file is a collection of calibrated
spectra, where inspection, baseline subtraction, binning are all done,
and optionally gridding.
