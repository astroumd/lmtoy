# LMTOY pipeline workflow (March 2025)



##   A brief high level description of who/how/what/where the pipeline does

Stakeholders

* PO = Pipeline Operator, currently mostly Peter
* DA = Data Analyst (helpdesk), currently Alaina and Leyna
* PI = Proposer (PI) of the Project. Can be shared with co-PI's?

Here are the distinct steps, each with their own timeline

1. Pipeline on malt (PO; during observing, runs automatically, but needs manual start after a reboot) - see last100.html

2. Pipeline on unity (PO; incrementally run usually the day after observing) - see lmtoy_run

3. Pipeline on unity (DA; incrementally run in helpdesk account, can take few weeks)

4. Pipeline on unity (PO, after merging in the DA suggestions, usually within a week after merging)

5. Data can now be archived (PO; soon)
