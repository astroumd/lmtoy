#    28-dec-2020:     LMTSRL installed (more to come)
#     4-jan-2021:     try to be smart on finding LMT data; disable montage for now
#    12-feb-2021:     lmt_data -> data_lmt
#    23-feb-2021:     new options (venv, nemo)
#    11-may-2021:     use only $DATA_LMT, no more IRC_data
#    22-jul-2021:     better bootstrap on missing DATA_LMT
