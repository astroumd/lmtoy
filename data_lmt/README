This directory is just a placeholder for the raw LMT data.

The Makefile in here is useful for those working off-line.

Normally you don't want to use the space under $LMTOY for raw data. On
LMT machines you can often find them on /data_lmt. On private laptops
you probably should not store this data with the software. Usually during
the install you would use

    	    ./configure --with-data=/somewhere/data_lmt

or with the example install_lmtoy script

   	    install_lmtoy data_lmt=/somewhere/data_lmt
