This directory is just a placeholder for the raw LMT data.

The Makefile in here is useful for those working off-line.

Normally you don't want to use the space under $LMTOY for raw data. On
LMT machines you can often find them on /data_lmt. On private laptops
you probably should not store this data with the software. Usually during
the install you would use

    	    ./configure --with-data=/somewhere/data_lmt

or with the example install_lmtoy script

   	    install_lmtoy data_lmt=/somewhere/data_lmt

It is also possible to keep a private $LMTOY/data_lmt and use symbolic links
to the actual data (e.g. to maintain your data_lmt.log file).

As of this writing you will need to following symlinks:

ifproc
rsr
RedshiftChassis0
RedshiftChassis1
RedshiftChassis2
RedshiftChassis3
spectrometer/roach0
spectrometer/roach1
spectrometer/roach2
spectrometer/roach3
