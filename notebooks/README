notebooks evolve:
 These three initially checked notebooks are old, but were updated to work wiht the current LMTSLR

This is unfinished.

There are also 3 notebooks in the root directory of LMTSLR:


BS_example.ipynb
PipelineProcessExample.ipynb  (OTF, but cheating via the -c parfile approach)
PS_EXAMPLE.ipynb
